DESCRIPTION:

This project is a Speech-to-Text Transcription Tool developed in Python using the speech_recognition library. It allows users to speak through a microphone and automatically transcribes the spoken words into written text. The tool is designed to be interactive, user-friendly, and efficient, making it a great fit for projects or internships in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) domains.

The tool captures voice input through the system's default microphone, processes the audio in real time, and converts it to text using Google‚Äôs Web Speech API. After successful transcription, the text is optionally saved to a timestamped output file for reference or future use.

This tool demonstrates core AI concepts including speech recognition, real-time audio processing, API integration, and error handling ‚Äî making it highly useful for educational purposes, prototype development, or research in human-computer interaction.

Key Features and Functionality:

1.Microphone-Based Voice Input:

Automatically detects the system microphone.

Uses ambient noise adjustment to improve speech accuracy.

2.Customizable Listening Behavior(‚è±Ô∏è):

Waits for the user to press Enter before starting recording.

Adjustable pause_threshold to allow natural pauses while speaking.

3.Real-Time Speech Recognition(üß†):

Converts voice to text using Google Web Speech API.

Supports fluent English transcription with high accuracy.

4.Automatic File Logging:

Saves the recognized speech to a .txt file.

Each entry is timestamped with the current date and time.

5.Error Handling & Retry Option(üîÅ):

Catches common issues like silence, unintelligible speech, or no internet.

If transcription fails, the user is prompted to try again.

6.Clean and Clear Output:

Displays both prompts and recognized text clearly in the console.

Great for terminal-based interactions and AI demos.

This system offers a clear starting point for anyone looking to integrate speech-to-text functionality into their Python projects.
